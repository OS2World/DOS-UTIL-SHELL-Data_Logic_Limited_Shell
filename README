________________________________________________________________________________

This is an implementation of the Unix Shell for MSDOS.  As far as possible it
is compatible with the System V.4 program sh(1) with ksh(1) extension.  The
following differences are noted:

1)  Background or asynchronous commands are not supported under MSDOS.  Some
    support is provided under OS/2, but it is not as full as UNIX.  You can
    only run one command and not a pipeline in background.

2)  Certain internal commands which have no equivalent MSDOS or OS/2 supported
    functionality support (ulimit, time etc) are not provided.

3)  Command hashing and accounting are not supported.

4)  Some of the ksh functionality has not yet been implemented or made ksh
    compatible (see Notes file).

5)  The Shell uses all variables starting with a ~ (tilde) internally and will
    not allow you to display them.  I don't think this is a difference from
    the user's view, just internally.

The Shell has been tested mainly under MSDOS 3.3, 4.01, 5.2, 6.0, 6.2 and OS/2
1.3, 2.0 and 2.1.  It has exposed some shortcomings in the C6.0 compiler and
MSDOS library.  As such, using C5.1 and its library are prefered when
re-building the shell for MSDOS.

The following enhancements have been made for the MSDOS environment.  These
enhancements are described in the appropriate section of the manual pages.

1)  Under MSDOS (16-bit version), the Shell will swap itself out to one of
    the following:

    - Expanded memory
    - Extended memory
    - Disk (this is the slowest)

    The swapping is controlled by the shell internal command swap.  If
    swapping is enabled, the shell only uses 3K of memory whilst a child
    process is executing.

    Note: Swapping to Extended memory is probably the most dangerous unless
	  you have an XMS memory manager available.  The shell requires the
	  XMS manager to support the version 2 XMS specification.

2)  Command line editing has been added for non VI or EMACS mode.  A
    configuration file (sh.ini) allows the Command Line editing keys to be
    tailored to the users requirements.

3)  The command line prompt can be programmed to display 'useful' information.

4)  The shell uses Unix format file names (ie slashes and not backslashes) to
    delimit directories.  Some programs require certain environment variables
    to be in MS-DOS format (using backslashes).  The msdos or typeset -H
    commands allows these variables to be marked so that they are set correctly
    when the environment for a program is set up.

5)  The format of the command line which the shell passes to a program is
    configurable between normal, indirect files and environment variables
    (see SH.1).  A version of stdargv.c which supports the indirect file
    format (and wildcards from a normal command line) is included.

6)  Wild cards on drives (ie echo *:*.c will echo all the C files in the
    current directories of each drive) are supported.

7)  Full Interrupt 24 processing has been added.

8)  Alternate command interpreters are supported in shell scripts a la
    Unix V.4.

9)  A number of OS/2 internal commands (start, detach) have been addded.

10) The Notes file describes the fixes and changes between Release 2.1 and
    2.2

11) Significant parts of the shell have been re-written this release 2.1.


The following Bugs are known to exist in the Shell.

1)  See Notes file.

2)  EMACS line editing mode is not enabled or tested.

3)  I may have mis-interpreted the functionality of either the UNIX version
    of sh or ksh (tell me about it).

The shell was built using Microsoft C 5.1 and MASM v5.1 in large model mode
for MSDOS and Microsoft C6.0 for OS/2 (16 bit) and WATCOM 9 for both 32-bit
versions.

In addition, the version of open in your library must pass the O_NOINHERIT bit
on the MSDOS kernel.  The Microsoft C v5.1 library (and possibly the v6.0) does
not pass this bit on to the MSDOS open System call.  I fixed this using CodeView
to find where the library function masks off the bottom 2 bits.  Extracted the
object from the library and patched mask from 0x03 to 0x83 in the object and
reload into the library.  No Problem.  The Patch.Lib document describes the
process in more detail.

You can do want you like with this software as long as you don't sell it or
remove the Copyright notices in the sources or object.
